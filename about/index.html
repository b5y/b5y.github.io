<p>My journey into computer science is quite typical. I developed an interest in mathematics and physics during my secondary school studies. I got interested in maths and physics when I studied in secondary school.
After graduating from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Petersburg_Lyceum_239"  class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Presidential Physics and Mathematics Lyceum 239</a>,
I decided to continue my education at one of the most prestigious and renowned faculties in Russia—the Mathematics and Mechanics Faculty of <a href="http://english.spbu.ru"  class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Saint Petersburg State University</a>, which is among the top universities in the country.</p>
<p>At some point, I realized that software engineering, due to the lack of mathematics in my work, was quite boring for me. I intended to apply for a double-degree master’s program at <a href="https://en.itmo.ru/"  class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ITMO University</a> and <a href="https://www.uva.nl/en"  class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">University of Amsterdam</a>.
After applying for exchange studies at Aalto University, I secured a Research Assistant position in the <a href="https://research.cs.aalto.fi/pml/"  class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Probabilistic Machine Learning Group</a> under the supervision of Distinguished Professor Samuel Kaski.
I had always wanted to try myself as a teacher and was honored to be a Teaching Assistant for the <a href="https://mycourses.aalto.fi/course/view.php?id=20569&amp;section=5"  class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Machine Learning: Basic Principles</a> course taught by <a href="https://users.aalto.fi/~junga1/"  class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alex Jung</a>.
Since that time, I decided to stay in Finland.</p>
<p>Passionate about Machine Learning and AI engineering.</p>
