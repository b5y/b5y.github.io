<p>My journey into computer science is quite typical. I developed an interest in mathematics and physics during my secondary school studies.
After graduating from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Petersburg_Lyceum_239"  class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Presidential Physics and Mathematics Lyceum 239</a>,
I continued my education at one of Russia&rsquo;s most prestigious and renowned faculties—the Mathematics and Mechanics Faculty of <a href="http://english.spbu.ru"  class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Saint Petersburg State University</a>, which is among the top universities in the country.</p>
<p>At some point, I realised that software engineering was quite boring for me due to the lack of mathematics in my work. I intended to apply for a double-degree master’s program at <a href="https://en.itmo.ru/"  class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ITMO University</a> and <a href="https://www.uva.nl/en"  class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">University of Amsterdam</a>.
After applying for exchange studies at Aalto University, I secured a Research Assistant position in the <a href="https://research.cs.aalto.fi/pml/"  class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Probabilistic Machine Learning Group</a> under the supervision of Distinguished Professor Samuel Kaski.
I had always wanted to try myself as a teacher and was honored to be a Teaching Assistant for the <a href="https://mycourses.aalto.fi/course/view.php?id=20569&amp;section=5"  class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Machine Learning: Basic Principles</a> course taught by <a href="https://users.aalto.fi/~junga1/"  class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alex Jung</a>.
Since then, I have decided to stay in Finland.</p>
<p>My master&rsquo;s thesis at Aalto University (Machine Learning, Data Science and Artificial Intelligence) focused on medical image analysis using the NaViT model.</p>
<p>I am passionate about machine learning and generative AI.</p>

<p>I have worked remotely with different teams located on five continents. Here are some of the recommendations from my former colleagues about my past work (a complete list is on my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mehtimusayev/"  class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LinkedIn page</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Having had the pleasure of working with Mehti these past few years, I must say he is a true professional and a joy to have on the team. He is smart, interactive, and someone that always drives the project with the business goals in mind. A true team player, and someone others sought out for advice and leadership.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Tom C.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>It is my absolute pleasure to recommend Mehti. I thoroughly enjoyed my time working with him. Mehti&rsquo;s leadership on machine learning projects and product thinking was a great asset to the team. In terms of analytical skills, meticulousness, and work quality, Mehti is unbeatable, and I can&rsquo;t emphasize this enough.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Mayank M.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Mehti knows data. His AI, big data analysis, and development expertise spanned across all aspects of our company, from leading development of AI based internal and consumer products with the dev team, to helping marketing and bizdev make smarter strategic decisions using historical dataset analysis.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>John C.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>I have personally worked with Mehti on a daily basis in the field of data science &amp; machine learning for a long time. In one of our projects where we worked closely together, I got to see a very unique side of him, where he was able to seamlessly navigate through a very challenging project end-to-end - a skill which is not easily found; right from conceptualization of business use-cases to planning, developing and delivering solutions through tactical and diligent development approaches.</p>
